Description :
The goal of the website is to tackle hunger and food waste which are major problems in the country. to achieve this, we give suppliers and retailers a platform to enable them to redistribute their excess food before it goes back and through a fast and efficient logistics process, we take the food to the various food banks and charities so they can distribute the food among the members of oour society struggling with food security. thus, the process reduces the amount of food wasted, which is harmful to the environment and we also reduce the amount of people going without food.
